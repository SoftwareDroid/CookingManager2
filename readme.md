## Install Instruction for MAC
Tested for: macOS Mojave (VM)

pipenv does not work on mac (Gtk causes problems). All dependencies are therefore installed globally. Use *python3 main.py* to start the application.

1. git clone the project
2. Switch to the Project Root Dictionary
3. Execute sh helpers/setup_for_mac.sh
